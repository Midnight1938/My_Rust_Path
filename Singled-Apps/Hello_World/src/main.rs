// You can manipulate expressions more easily with block comments
// than with line comments. Cuz you can use them in the middle of the code


fn main() {
    let name = "Skshm";
    let (x,y) = (8,2);

    println!("Hello, world!");
    println!("Adding: {}", x+y);
    println!("My name {}", name);
}
